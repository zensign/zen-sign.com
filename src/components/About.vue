          If you haven't caught this by now, my name is <strong>Zack Ensign</strong>. I've been been developing Apps and Websites for over a dozen years. I've worked with good, bad, and ugly technologies and frameworks. On desktop, mobile, and physical installations. For start-ups, boutique shops, and corporations. Across a few different states. It's been a hell of a ride!

          When I'm not doing that, I'm trying to juggle writing and recording of original music. Sometimes by myself, but often with friends and bandmates. Guitars, drums, microphones, and synths make me happy.
